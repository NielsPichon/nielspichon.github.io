**Welcome to my humble** blog where I narrate my numerous (failed) attemps
at building things. I enjoy a wide range of topics, so hopefully I'll get to
cover many fun things: Computer science, AI, electronics, procedural generation,
game development, music, 3d, physics...

I hope you'll find some of it useful and it'll make you want to try things
out too!

Professionally, I am currently working a Machine Learning Engineer in France,
and **am open for work,** both as a freelancer and as an employee.
I have an MSc in Physics and Nanothecnology from the
Technical University of Denmark (DTU) as well as a General Engineering degree
(MSc equivalent) from Ecole Centrale de Lyon.

You can find some of these projects on [Github](https://github.com/NielsPichon)
