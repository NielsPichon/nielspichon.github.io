**Electron avalanche** is a process by which a free electron with a high energy
collides with an atom, tearing off an electron and transferring some of
its energy to it.
The new electron then collides with another atom, and so on, creating a
chain reaction. With the right conditions, this might even snowball into a nice
glowing hot plasma.

My name is Niels; Welcome to my humble blog, where I narrate my numerous
(often unfinished) attempts at building things.
I enjoy a wide range of topics, so hopefully I'll get to
cover many fun things: Computer science, AI, electronics, procedural generation,
game development, music, 3d, physics...

I hope you'll find some of it useful and it'll make you want to try things
out too!

Professionally, I have been working as a Machine Learning Engineer
for a few years now. I am currently based in Lyon, France.
I have an MSc in Physics and Nanotechnology from the
Technical University of Denmark (DTU) as well as a General Engineering degree
(MSc equivalent) from Ecole Centrale de Lyon.

I **am open for work,** both as a freelancer and as an employee
(full remote or hybrid is possible).
